            I’m taking this course due to my interest in coding and web development.

        <li>
            I have some experience with HTML, Python, Java and C++.
        </li>

        <li>
            My goals are to learn how to create a website from scratch and to gain a better understanding of web development.

            A data type is different than its value. Some programming languages are strongly typed, requiring programmers to predefine what kind of data they are using in variables, parameters, functions, etc. before they actually use them.
        Other loosely typed languages like Javascript, Perl, and PHP, do not require programmers to define their type ahead of time. Booleans, integers, floats and strings are common primitive data types that can be found across many programming languages. Null and undefined are types that represent no data. Most programming languages allow you to convert data types, this conversion can also happen automatically which is known as “implicit conversion”. To add on, there are also other types known as arrays, objects, lists and etc.

                        <li>
                            The visuals and animations immediately grabbed my attention. The content of the website makes it seem as if I’m reading a story that I can also interact with.

                            The visuals and creativity are stunning and makes me want to dig deeper into the website. There’s an abundance of information and the colors and design makes me as a viewer feel like I should explore the website longer.

                            The beautiful visuals and soothing music interested me because it was unique. The creativity of the website mixed with original produced music was something I never seen before which was truly remarkable.
